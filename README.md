**Innovative Idea** </br>
The platform is going to be similar to RateMyProfessor and Yelp, we will show star ratings than numerical rating and also accept half ratings. There will also be a multitude of rating criterias such as Food Quality, Customer Service, Location, and Price to calculate the Overall rating of the review. However, this platform will be for UMass Students and Faculty to post reviews of UMass Dining Halls' food.

**Data** </br>

- Likes: Student can like or dislike other reviews, shown by a whole number.
- User comments: Student can write comments in the review about the food they ate.
- Rating: Student can specify the satisfactory level on food quality, customer service, atmosphere and time to spend to find a seat or table.
- Overall Review: Each dinning hall has a rating that is calculated using all the rating from students' post.
