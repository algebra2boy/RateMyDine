**Innovative Idea** </hr>
The platform is going to be similar to RateMyProfessor and Yelp, we will show star ratings than numerical rating and also accept half ratings. There will also be a multitude of rating criterias such as Food Quality, Customer Service, Location, and Price to calculate the Overall rating of the review. However, this platform will be for UMass Students and Faculty to post reviews of UMass Dining Halls' food.
