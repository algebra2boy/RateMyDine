<h2>Login</h2>

The design for the login/sign up page was heavily inspired by traditional login pages from other websites, among which was the design of the other UMASS websites like Spire. We wanted to keep the color scheme and layout as familiar and intuitive as possible, hence why it looks as generic as it does. With this approach, there's an implict guide for all users who're familiar with the internet since it just functions the same as any other website layout wise. 

<h2>Home Page</h2>

Again, UMASS applications and webpages were the inspiration for the home page. Though we took a few liberties here and there and what resulted was a design that seemed "mobile-like". We have tiles that take users to their respective dining hall pages, and a login/sign-up link on the top right. The text box in the middle's functionality (as of writing this) is tentative and we're not sure whether to turn it into a search bar or some fun little toy that a user can use (in which case we're still not sure what to do). But the functionality of the other pieces of the page are there--the home page takes the users to the dining hall pages, and is the central hub where users can get a general overview of practically everything the website provides.
